### Big Data Processing Pipeline (Apache Spark + AWS S3)
A serverless data processing workflow using AWS Lambda, S3, and IAM. Designed an event-driven architecture that automatically processes JSON files uploaded to S3, performs data analysis using Pandas, and stores results in a structured format. Deployed custom Python packages as Lambda layers and configured IAM policies for secure execution.
